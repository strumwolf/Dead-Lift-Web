      | In 2007, with the departure of co-founder Tony DiSorbo (drums), 
      | line up changes were made. Bob Lavoy made quite an impact from the start. 
      | “Poor Man’s Anthem” is a harder hitting, more cohesive form of the original design. 
      | “Break-Down”, “No Compromise” and “Never Lay Down and Die” show the driving beats 
      | and flowing guitars that has evolved from the new line up. Title track, “Poor Man’s Anthem”, 
      | describes the present day struggle for the common man, as we all can relate to. 
      | The whole album embodies this view of making end’s meet, hardship of the middle class…it’s truly a Poor Man’s Anthem.
